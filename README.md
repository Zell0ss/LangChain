# First Steps With LangChain

This folder contains the code examples from the Real Python course on getting started with LangChain.

You'll need to set up your own OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. Then, you can run the provided scripts.

If you run a script with the `-i` flag, then Python drops you into interactive mode and you can play around, following along exactly what happens in each course lesson.
 
Additionally, you can read the in-depth associated tutorial on [Build an LLM RAG Chatbot With LangChain](https://realpython.com/build-llm-rag-chatbot-with-langchain/).
