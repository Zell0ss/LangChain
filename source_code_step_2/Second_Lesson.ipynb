    "# Business Requirements and Data\n",
    "Before you start working on any AI project, you need to understand the problem that you want to solve and make a plan for how you’re going to solve it. This involves \n",
    "- clearly defining the problem\n",
    "- gathering requirements\n",
    "- understanding the data and technology available to you\n",
    "- setting clear expectations with stakeholders.\n",
    "## Understand the Problem and Requirements\n",
    "The need: stakeholders would like a system that answers to ad-hoc questions about patients, visits, physicians, hospitals, and insurance payers without having to understand a query language like SQL, request a report from an analyst, or wait for someone to build a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets think Agent-like: we will gather a couple of questions and think wich tool could answer them \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical questions:\n",
    "- What is the current wait time at XYZ hospital?\n",
    "- Which hospital currently has the shortest wait time?\n",
    "- At which hospitals are patients complaining about billing and insurance issues?\n",
    "- Have any patients complained about the hospital being unclean?\n",
    "- What have patients said about how doctors and nurses communicate with them?\n",
    "- What are patients saying about the nursing staff at XYZ hospital?\n",
    "- What was the total billing amount charged to Cigna payers in 2023?\n",
    "- How many patients has Dr. John Doe treated?\n",
    "- How many visits are open and what is their average duration in days?\n",
    "- Which physician has the lowest average visit duration in days?\n",
    "- How much was billed for patient 789’s stay?\n",
    "- Which hospital worked with the most Cigna patients in 2023?\n",
    "- What’s the average billing amount for emergency visits by hospital?\n",
    "- Which state had the largest percent increase inedicaid visits from 2022 to 2023?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools to answer them:\n",
    "- for budget&billing queries an sql query should be dinamically generated by the chatbot and pointed to the data\n",
    "- for user reviews queries the chatbot should be able to manage them with a vector database and a retriever, just like in lesson 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent should be able to distinguish between this two kind of questions and call the appropriate tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore the available data\n",
    "Before building your chatbot, you need a thorough understanding of the data it will use to respond to user queries. This will help you determine what’s feasible and how you want to structure the data so that your chatbot can easily access it. All of the data you’ll use in this article was synthetically generated, and much of it was derived from a popular (health care dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset] on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the following datasets would likely be stored as tables in a SQL database, but you’ll work with CSV files to keep the focus on building the chatbot. They are all on ./data folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### hospital.csv\n",
    "A dimension table.\n",
    "- hospital_id: An integer that uniquely identifies a hospital.\n",
    "- hospital_name: The hospital’s name.\n",

    "\n",
    "This flowchart illustrates how data moves through your chatbot, starting from the user’s input query all the way to the final response. Here’s a summary of each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain Agent: The LangChain agent is the brain of your chatbot. Given a user query, the agent decides which tool to call and what to give the tool as input. The agent then observes the tool’s output and decides what to return to the user—this is the agent’s response.\n",
    "- Neo4j AuraDB: You’ll store both structured hospital system data and patient reviews in a Neo4j AuraDB graph database. You’ll learn all about this in the next section.\n",
    "- LangChain Neo4j Cypher Chain: This will be the data mining chain, fit for queries about billing ammounts, gains per doctor and so on so forth. This chain willñ try to convert the user query into Cypher, Neo4j’s query language, and execute the Cypher query in Neo4j. The chain then answers the user query using the Cypher query results. The chain’s response is fed back to the LangChain agent and sent to the user.\n",
    "- LangChain Neo4j Reviews Vector Chain: This is very similar to the chain you built in Step 1, except now patient review embeddings are stored in Neo4j. The chain searches for relevant reviews based on those semantically similar to the user query, and the reviews are used to answer the user query.\n",
    "- Wait Times Function: this will be the review mining chain. Similar to the logic in Step 1, the LangChain agent tries to extract a hospital name from the user query. The hospital name is passed as input to a Python function that gets wait times, and the wait time is returned to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To walk through an example, suppose a user asks *How many emergency visits were there in 2023?* The LangChain agent will receive this question and decide which tool (hospital waiting, data mining or review mining), if any, to pass the question to. In this case, the agent should pass the question to the *LangChain Neo4j Cypher Chain*. The chain will try to convert the question to a Cypher query, run the Cypher query in Neo4j, and use the query results to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the LangChain Neo4j Cypher Chain answers the question, it will return the answer to the agent, and the agent will relay the answer to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries about reviews or waiting time will be routed similary but by their own chain. \n"
